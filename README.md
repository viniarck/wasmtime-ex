Elixir WebAssembly runtime powered by Wasmtime

## Installation

You can add `wasmtime` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:wasmtime, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

This package is still under heavy development, I'd recommend you to wait for the `0.2.0` release since the core API might still change, feel free to explore it in the meantime. Enjoy!
